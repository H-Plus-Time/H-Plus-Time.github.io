        Hi, you've reached the personal website of Nicholas Roberts, a Melbourne, Australia based Computer Science student (anticipated Feb '17).
      </p>
      This is no ordinary personal website, as you may have noticed by the hints of app-like behaviour (read: poorly concealed self-promotion). Open up Chrome Dev Tools (or Web Console, if you're running Firefox) to poke around the salient features, namely:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Service worker - background syncs, push notifications. Mainly used for robust resource caching here.
        </li>
        <li>
          WebComponents (Polymer sugared) - standards-track UI components, sans-transpilation.
        </li>
        <!-- <li>
          HTTP/2 server push - does what it says on the tin, pitfalls (i.e. unprompted extra bandwidth usage) neatly avoided via service worker request interception.
        </li> -->
        <li>
          AppCache automatic fallback - all credit to surge.sh.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lazy-loaded resources - defers work until after users have engaged.
        </li>
        <li>
          Precisely <b>zero</b> webfonts - and zero kB to download them ;).
        </li>
      </ul>
      Finally, the source code for this website is available at <a href="https://github.com/H-Plus-Time/hplustime.com">GitHub</a>
